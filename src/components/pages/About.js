          <p>Hello! My name is Tori Booker. I am a self-motivated individual with a record of success in troubleshooting and problem resolution. 
            I am committed to life-long learning of skills and knowledge with a variety of experiences in education, information technology, business, eCommerce and retail, including management and supervisory experience. 
            I have an extensive experience with PC computer systemsâ€”qualified in inter-office computer hardware and software troubleshooting and staff training.</p>
          <p>Honestly, I feel like I've had a variety positions which contributed to the hard worker and team player I am today. In a snapshot, I've 
            loaded and unloaded trucks for FedEx and UPS. I was a part-time supervisor at UPS as well. I've stocked shelves in a discount store, became a desktop publisher
            at OfficeMax, and fixed computers at Best Buy's Geek Squad.</p>
          <p>But, before all of those positions, I was just a teenager so blown away by the "world wide web" that I decided to teach myself HTML at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.
            I loved coding so much that I continue to pursue the technology field and even took a course on C# at a community college and graduated from ITT with a degree in Multimedia.</p>
          <p>I look forward to what to the future holds and I hope you enjoy my work.</p>
